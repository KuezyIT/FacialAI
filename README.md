# FacialAI
This project is my very first project about artifical intelligence and recognition.
The project itself is not really based on a AI, instead it uses the face-api for calculation/recognition.

FacialAI is capable of:
* Face Recognition
* Emotion Recognition
* Age Guessing
* Gender Recognition

It is based on a terminal theme with a bit of animations on the index.html.

In the future, a additional feature called Picture Recognition will be implemented. It will be capable of recognition of famous persons, and a must have, **[Harold Finch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Finch_(Person_of_Interest))**.

# Known Bugs
1. It is known for being sometimes performance consuming
2. The canvas (Including the box, and text) is currently not precisely placed, it might have a little offset off the acual face
3. Not all pages are animated, just the index.html for now

# Getting started

# Support
If you find a bug, vulnerability or things I should improve in this project, simply open a Issue in this repository and leave some details in it for my review.
If you like my work, the projects I do and also the public repositories, I'd be happy if you would support me by starring this repo.

Kind regards
